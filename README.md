# hello-world

Hi! Creative Humans! I wanna help your to start music project.
I will gather people who agree your art philosophy. The larger people participate your project, the more quality of realization would be improved. Then, Your members who have known each other shortly will be like collective intelligence.

First, pick 3 artists who match well with your concept.

Second, which genre are you in, like jazz, R&B, synthpop, electronics?

Third, just show me picture to describe your project, which could be refreshing, cool, cute, melancholy, erotic, or freak pictures.

Done? I will recommend your future co-worker's instagram or facebook.
